### Ehsan Mozhdeh (ihsun galliano) is a software engineer with experience since 2016.

He designs and builds backend services and mobile apps that are made to survive real-world use â€” under real load, with real deadlines, and real users who donâ€™t care how elegant the code is (unless it breaks).

His main tools include:
- Python & Django & FastAPI â€” for solid, maintainable APIs
- Flutter â€” for cross-platform mobile apps with native-like performance
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and a healthy respect for production

ðŸ“Œ This is a new GitHub profile (the original one was affected by regional access limitations), but the experience behind it spans nearly a decade.

Key values in his work:
- Code that remains understandable months later
- Clarity and maintainability over cleverness
- Logs that tell the truth
- Systems that are boring â€” in a good way

He has contributed to:
- Fintech systems with thousands of daily users
- Scalable e-commerce and logistics platforms
- Internal tools designed for fast teams, not fancy code

Available for thoughtful collaborations, distributed teams, and real-world projects that reward focus over flair.
